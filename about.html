        <h1>We are <strong>str.ucture</strong></h1>
        <p>...an architecture and engineering firm based in Stuttgart. As a company, we are committed to creating a sustainable and CO₂-neutral built environment. Our focus is on a lightweight construction approach that emphasizes the minimization of material consumption and the use of natural and sustainable materials. Digital tools and networked planning technologies help us to develop innovative and sustainable solutions with our partners in interdisciplinary teams. Simulation techniques such as flow or urban climate simulation enable us to understand and minimize the impact of buildings on the microclimate in cities. We also rely on data-based planning and artificial intelligence methods. We work in numerous collaborations with companies and experts as well as in the context of national and international research programs to integrate state-of-the-art developments into planning processes and develop them further. We are your partner for digital transformation in the field of urban climate and are at your side to strengthen urban resilience and effectively design climate adaptation measures.</p>

        <!-- <h1>Technology:</h1>
        <p>Rapid urbanization and Urban Heat Islands (UHI), in addition to the growing threat of climate change, pose a major challenge to urban sustainability and public health. Microclimate modeling and simulations performed using different scenarios can be used to study UHI, their impacts and subsequent adaptation measures. The PALM system (Parallelized Large-eddy Simulation Model, <a href="https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de">https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de</a>), a state-of-the-art microclimate simulation software, can be successfully used to simulate and predict the microclimate in urban areas and UHIs. In this study, PALM-4U is used to simulation the microclimate in Neuperlach, Munich, Germany. The focus is on investigating the impact of urban infrastructures on the local microclimate</p>
