        "para1": "The simulation focuses on the northern and central areas of Neuperlach, covering a domain size of 2048m by 2048m with a height of 1024m. This specific area was chosen to study and better understand the microclimate in Neuperlach, Munich. As Munich continues to urbanize, new buildings are being constructed, which, combined with climate change and global warming, can make the urban microclimate increasingly challenging and uncomfortable. To address these potential issues, it's crucial to study the city's microclimate in detail. For this reason, a typical hot summer day in August was selected for the simulation, which was carried out using PALM-4U.",
        "para2": "In this study, we specifically focus on the impact of a sustainable structure designed by Str.ucture GmbH on the local microclimate of northern Neuperlach. The structure, created by Str.ucture GmbH, was placed on an open ground in Ramersdorf-Perlach, and a simulation was conducted to assess its effects. Further analysis was then carried out to understand the current microclimate conditions and the changes introduced by this structure. By examining these effects, we aim to gain insights into how sustainable design can contribute to improving urban microclimates. This research could provide valuable guidance for future urban planning in Munich, particularly in managing the challenges posed by climate change."
